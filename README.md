# Crunchbase-assignment
Assignment to analyse dataset from Crunchbase 2014

## Things I want to implement still
- Regularization and scaling in order to reduce rfe and model fit time
- Add features from investments (average investment per round, number of investors)
- Try to tune/improve the model by running iterative comparison tests (using AUC?)
- Clean the code!!
